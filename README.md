# React GraphQL Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Use

- Clone the repository
- `$ yarn`
- `$ yarn start`
- http://localhost:3000

## Basic ideas

- Apollo Client wraps components. Now graphql query is binded to the component.
- Apollo Client connects components with graphql sources and pass data by props.

## Mockup

- Local graphql source mockup implemented
- Edit schema.js for schema
- Edit mocks.js for fake providers
